# My First Python Automation Script

![Project Screenshot](../images/first-python-script.png)

**Description**: This project is a Python automation script that automates the task of renaming files in bulk based on a set pattern.

## Key Features:
- Batch processing multiple files
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Regex integration for flexible renaming patterns

## What I Learned:
- How to interact with file systems using Python.
- Implementing regular expressions for real-world tasks.
- Command-line user interface design principles.

## Future Improvements:
- Adding a GUI interface for easier use.
- Support for additional file formats.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def rename_files(directory):
    for file in os.listdir(directory):
        if file.endswith(".txt"):
            os.rename(file, f"renamed_{file}")
