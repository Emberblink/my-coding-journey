I’m Torr 👋\rI’m a legally blind gamer and aspiring developer who’s diving deep into the world of coding, game development, and tech.\nDue to my limited vision, I can only spend a short amount of time looking at a monitor, so my pace will naturally be a bit slower than most. But I’m in no rush — this is my journey, and I’m here to enjoy the process.\nMy current goal is to learn Python and build small projects to gain real experience. Eventually, I want to create my own automation scripts to make life easier and solve real-world problems.\nOnce I’m confident with Python, I plan to start learning GDScript and use Godot to build small, fun games — the kind I’ve always dreamed of making.\nThis site is where I’ll document everything: my projects, lessons, wins, and even the struggles. If you’re curious about how someone with limited vision takes on code and game dev — you’re in the right place.\nMore coming soon — thanks for stopping by!"},"title":"About Me"},"/blog/my-first-post/":{"data":{"":"This is the first post on my journey to becoming a game developer! 🚀\nI’ll be sharing what I learn as I go."},"title":"My First Post"},"/portfolio/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Welcome to my portfolio!

The community is welcoming and full of resources. It runs well on lower-spec hardware, which is important for my setup. It’s Python-like, making the learning curve smoother as I learn to code. 🎮 Projects Coming Soon!\nThis section will showcase all the little games and experiments I build as I learn GDScript and game development in Godot.\nStay tuned!"},"title":"Godot Projects"},"/portfolio/python/":{"data":{"":"Python is one of the most beginner-friendly and powerful programming languages out there.\nIt’s used in everything from web development and automation to data science and game development — which makes it the perfect starting point for my coding journey.\nI chose Python because:\nThe syntax is clean and easy to understand. It has a massive community and tons of learning resources. It’s perfect for building small tools, scripts, and eventually game logic.

Great beginner-friendly project to practice using Python’s input() and string manipulation. 📚 What I Learned:\rGetting comfortable with Python’s input() and print() functions. Basic string concatenation. User interaction through the command line. 🚀 Future Improvements:\rAdd more fun variations for band names. Integrate a random name generator for extra creativity. 🧩 Code Snippet:\rprint(\"Hello and welcome to the Band Name Generator!\") city = input(\"What city did you grow up in?\\n\") pet_name = input(\"What is the name of your pet?\\n\") print(\"Your band name is \" + city + \" \" + pet_name)","-future-improvements#🚀 Future Improvements:":"","-key-features#✨ Key Features:":"","-live-demo#🎮 Live Demo":"","-what-i-learned#📚 What I Learned:":""},"title":"Band Name Generator"}}
