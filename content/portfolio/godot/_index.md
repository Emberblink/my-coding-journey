Godot is an open-source game engine that supports both 2D and 3D game development.  
Itâ€™s lightweight, fast to set up, and has a clean scripting language called **GDScript** thatâ€™s similar to Python â€” making it a perfect choice for me as a beginner.

I chose Godot over other engines like Unity and Unreal because:
- It's fully open-source, with no licensing fees.
- The community is welcoming and full of resources.
- It runs well on lower-spec hardware, which is important for my setup.
- Itâ€™s Python-like, making the learning curve smoother as I learn to code.

This section will showcase all the little games and experiments I build as I learn GDScript and game development in Godot.

Stay tuned!
