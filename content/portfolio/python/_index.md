Python is one of the most beginner-friendly and powerful programming languages out there.  
It‚Äôs used in everything from web development and automation to data science and game development ‚Äî which makes it the perfect starting point for my coding journey.

I chose Python because:
- The syntax is clean and easy to understand.
- It has a massive community and tons of learning resources.
- It‚Äôs perfect for building small tools, scripts, and eventually game logic.
- It integrates well with many other tools, including Godot.
