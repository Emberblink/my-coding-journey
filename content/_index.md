    Hi there! I'm a self-taught developer currently learning **Python**, **GDScript**, and building small games in **Godot**.  
    This site is where I document my journey, share my projects, and reflect on what I learn along the way.

    Thanks for stopping by â€” I hope you enjoy watching this adventure unfold!
