## Hey there! I'm Torr ðŸ‘‹

I'm a legally blind gamer and aspiring developer who's diving deep into the world of coding, game development, and tech.

Due to my limited vision, I can only spend a short amount of time looking at a monitor, so my pace will naturally be a bit slower than most. But I'm in no rush â€” this is my journey, and I'm here to enjoy the process.

My current goal is to **learn Python** and build small projects to gain real experience. Eventually, I want to create my own automation scripts to make life easier and solve real-world problems.

Once Iâ€™m confident with Python, I plan to start learning **GDScript** and use **Godot** to build small, fun games â€” the kind Iâ€™ve always dreamed of making.

This site is where Iâ€™ll document everything: my projects, lessons, wins, and even the struggles. If youâ€™re curious about how someone with limited vision takes on code and game dev â€” youâ€™re in the right place.
